## Installation üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Spotify Developer Account (for Spotify integration)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cipherex/local2stream.git
   cd local2stream
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install spotipy mutagen
   ```

3. **Set up Spotify credentials**
   
   **Step-by-step Spotify setup:**
   
   1. **Create Spotify App:**
      - Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
      - Log in with your Spotify account
      - Click "Create App"
      - Fill in app details:
        - App Name: `Local2Stream` (or any name you prefer)
        - App Description: `Transfer local music to Spotify playlists`
        - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
        - Check "Web API" and agree to terms
      - Click "Save"
   
   2. **Get Your Credentials:**
      - In your new app's dashboard, click "Settings"
      - Copy your **Client ID** (visible by default)
      - Click "View client secret" and copy your **Client Secret**
      - **Important:** Keep these credentials secure and never share them publicly
   
   3. **Verify Redirect URI:**
      - Ensure `http://localhost:8888/callback` is listed in your app's redirect URIs
      - This exact URI is required for authentication to work

## Usage üìñ

### Interactive Mode

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python local2stream_cli.py
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python local2stream_cli.py --help        # Show help
python local2stream_cli.py --version     # Show version
python local2stream_cli.py --config      # Use saved configuration
```

### First Run Setup

1. **Music Directory**: Enter the path to your music collection
2. **Playlist Name**: Choose a name for your new playlist
3. **Spotify Credentials**: Enter your Client ID and Client Secret
4. **Configuration**: Option to save settings for future use

## How It Works üîç

### Metadata Extraction
- Extracts metadata from audio file tags (ID3, FLAC, MP4)
- Falls back to filename parsing if metadata is missing
- Supports common filename formats like "Artist - Title"

### Intelligent Matching
1. **Exact Match**: Direct title and artist matching
2. **Fuzzy Match**: Similarity-based matching with confidence scores
3. **Title-Only Search**: When artist information is unavailable
4. **Artist Fallback**: Search by artist, then match titles

## Configuration üõ†Ô∏è

The tool creates a `local2stream_config.json` file to store your preferences:

```json
{
  "music_directory": "/path/to/your/music",
  "playlist_name": "Local2Stream Collection",
  "platforms": ["spotify"],
  "spotify": {
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
    "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8888/callback"
  }
}
```

## Output Files üìä

After processing, the tool generates several files:

- `added_tracks_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Successfully added tracks
- `not_found_tracks_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Tracks that couldn't be matched
- `local2stream_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`: Detailed results and statistics

## Example Output üìà
